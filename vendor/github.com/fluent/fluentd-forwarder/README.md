fluentd-forwarder
=================

Lightweight fluentd forwarder written in Go.

Build Instructions
------------------

Set GOPATH environment variable appropriately and do the following to 
get `fluentd_forwarder` under `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```
$ go get github.com/treasure-data/fluentd-forwarder/entrypoints/build
$ bin/build fluentd_forwarder
```

Running `fluentd_forwarder`
---------------------------

```
$ $GOPATH/bin/fluentd_forwarder
```

Without arguments, it simply listens on 127.0.0.1:24224 and forwards the events to 127.0.0.1:24225.

It gracefully stops in response to SIGINT.

If you want to specify where to forward the events, try the following:

```
$ $GOPATH/bin/fluentd_forwarder -to fluent://some-remote-node.local:24224
```

Command-line Options
--------------------

* -retry-interval

  Retry interval in which connection is tried against the remote agent.

  ```
  -retry-interval 5s
  ```

* -conn-timeout

  Connection timeout after which the connection has failed.

  ```
  -conn-timeout 10s
  ```

* -write-timeout

  Write timeout on wire.

  ```
  -write-timeout 30s
  ```

* -flush-interval

  Flush interval in which the events are forwareded to the remote agent .

  ```
  -flush-interval 5s
  ```

* -listen-on

  Interface address and port on which the forwarder listens.

  ```
  -listen-on 127.0.0.1:24224
  ```

* -to

  Host and port to which the events are forwarded.

  ```
  -to remote-host.local:24225
  -to fluent://remote-host.local:24225
  -to td+https://urlencoded-api-key@/*/*
  -to td+https://urlencoded-api-key@/database/*
  -to td+https://urlencoded-api-key@/database/table
  -to td+https://urlencoded-api-key@endpoint/*/*
  ```

* -ca-certs

  SSL CA certficates to be verified against when the secure connection is used. Must be in PEM format. You can use the [one bundled with td-client-ruby](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/treasure-data/td-client-ruby/master/data/ca-bundle.crt).

  ```
  -ca-certs ca-bundle.crt
  ```


* -buffer-path

  Directory / path on which buffer files are created. * may be used within the path to indicate the prefix or suffix like var/pre*suf

  ```
  -buffer-path /var/lib/fluent-forwarder
  -buffer-path /var/lib/fluent-forwarder/prefix*suffix
  ```

* -buffer-chunk-limit

  Maximum size of a buffer chunk

  ```
  -buffer-chunk-limit 16777216
  ```

* -parallelism

  Number of simultaneous connections used to submit events. It takes effect only when the target is td+http(s).

  ```
  -parallelism 1
  ```

* -log-level

  Logging level. Any one of the following values; CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO and DEBUG.

  ```
  -log-level DEBUG
  ```

* -log-file

  Species the path to the log file.  By default logging is performed to the standard error.  It may contain strftime(3)-like format specifications like %Y in any positions.  If the parent directory doesn't exist at the time the logging is performed, all the leading directories are created automatically so you can specify the path like `/var/log/fluentd_forwarder/%Y-%m-%d/fluentd_forwarder.log`

  ```
  -log-file /var/log/fluentd_forwarder.log
  ```

* -config

  Specifies the path to the configuration file.  The syntax is detailed below.

  ```
  -config /etc/fluentd-forwarder/fluentd-forwarder.cfg
  ```


Configuration File
------------------

The syntax of the configuration file is so-called INI format with the name of the primary section being `fluentd-forwarder`.  Each setting is named exactly the same as the command-line counterpart, except for `-config`. (It is not possible to refer to another configuation file from a configuration file)

```
[fluentd-forwarder]
to = fluent://remote.local:24224
buffer-chunk-limit = 16777216
flush-interval = 10s
retry-interval = 1s
```
